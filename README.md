# How to Run

1. Start the services:
    ```
    docker-compose up --build
    ```

2. Open in your browser:
    ```
    http://localhost:8080
    ```
    You will see the name of a spaceport.  
    Refresh the page â€” the name will change each time.

3. To stop the services:
    ```
    docker-compose down
    ```
